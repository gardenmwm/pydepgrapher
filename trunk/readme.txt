pyDepGrapher

This tool will take a csv file with a list of dependancies and output a 
dependancy graph. 
The config.ini file allows you to specify the graph parameters and parameters
for nodes (items) and edges (dependancies) using any support graphviz parameters
It is important to note that if you add custom types, you'll need to add them to
the type list for the specific type and then define them.
